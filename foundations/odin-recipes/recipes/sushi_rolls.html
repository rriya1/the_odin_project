    <h1>sushi rolls</h1>
    <p>
        Ingredients:
Sushi rice
Nori (seaweed sheets)
Fresh fish (like tuna or salmon)
Avocado
Cucumber
Soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger (for serving)
Instructions:
Start by preparing sushi rice according to the package instructions. It's essential to use short-grain rice for its sticky texture.
Lay a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi rolling mat, keeping a bowl of water nearby to wet your hands and prevent rice from sticking.
Wet your hands and spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving a small space at the top edge.
Arrange thin slices of fresh fish, avocado, and cucumber along the bottom edge of the rice.
Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the nori, rice, and fillings into a tight cylinder. Seal the edge with a bit of water.
Using a sharp knife, slice the roll into bite-sized pieces.
Serve the sushi rolls with soy sauce, a dollop of wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.
