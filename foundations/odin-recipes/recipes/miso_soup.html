    <h1>miso soup</h1>
    <p>
        Ingredients:
Miso paste
Dashi (fish or seaweed stock)
Tofu, cubed
Wakame seaweed
Green onions, chopped
Instructions:
In a pot, heat the dashi stock until hot but not boiling. Add cubed tofu and wakame seaweed.
Take a small amount of miso paste and dissolve it in a ladle with some of the hot stock. Add it back to the pot and stir well.
Simmer the soup for a few minutes, being careful not to boil it as high heat can destroy the miso's flavor.
Garnish with chopped green onions just before serving.
