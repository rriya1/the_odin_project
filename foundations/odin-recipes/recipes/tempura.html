    <h1>tempura</h1>
    <p>
        Ingredients:
Shrimp or vegetables (sweet potato, zucchini, etc.)
Tempura batter mix
Ice-cold water
Vegetable oil for frying
Instructions:
Prepare the tempura batter by mixing it with ice-cold water. The key is to keep the batter cold for a crispy texture.
Dip the shrimp or vegetables into the batter, ensuring an even coating.
In a deep fryer or large pot, heat vegetable oil to around 350°F (175°C).
Carefully place the battered items into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy.
Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.
Serve immediately with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, mirin, and dashi.
