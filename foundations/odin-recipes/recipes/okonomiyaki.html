    <h1>okonomiyaki</h1>
    <p>
        Ingredients:
Cabbage, shredded
Flour
Eggs
Thinly sliced pork belly
Okonomiyaki sauce
Japanese mayo
Instructions:
In a large bowl, mix shredded cabbage, flour, and eggs until a thick batter forms.
Heat a griddle or large pan over medium heat. Grease lightly.
Pour a portion of the batter onto the griddle and spread it out to form a thick pancake.
Place slices of thinly sliced pork belly on top of the batter.
Once the bottom is golden brown, carefully flip the okonomiyaki using spatulas.
Cook until the other side is also golden brown and the pork is cooked through.
Drizzle okonomiyaki sauce and Japanese mayo over the top before serving.
